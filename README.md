# Comptia_Linux_mindMap

Hello everyone, 

This is Linux mind map based on comptia linux + material.

There are three types of file type you can choose:
1. PDF
2. mm => for mindmap software
3. md => mark down

#Feel free to practice to use git command to download those files. Give me some suggestions for improving for the future.
